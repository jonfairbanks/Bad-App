Offline, Open-Source RAG

Ingest files for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), all without 3rd parties or sensitive data leaving your network.

- Offline Embeddings & LLMs Support (No OpenAI!)
- Streaming Responses
- Conversation Memory
- Chat Export

### Pre-Requisites

- A pre-existing Ollama instance
- Python 3.9+

### Setup

Local:
- `pip install pipenv && pipenv install`
- `pipenv shell && streamlit run main.py`

Docker:
- `docker compose up -d`

### Usage

- Set your Ollama endpoint and model under Settings
- Upload your documents for processing
- Once complete, ask questions based on your documents!

### To Do
- [x] Refactor
- [x] Migrate Chat Stream to Llama-Index
- [x] Implement Llama-Index Chat Engine with Memory
- [x] Swap to Llama-Index Chat Engine
- [x] Function to Handle File Embeddings
- [ ] Allow Users to Set LLM Settings
    - [x] System Prompt
    - [ ] Chat Mode
    - [x] top_k
    - [x] chunk_size
    - [ ] chunk_overlap
- [x] Allow Switching of Embedding Model & Settings
- [x] Delete Files after Index Created/Failed
- [ ] Function to Handle GitHub Repo Ingestion
- [ ] Support for JSON Files
- [x] Show Loaders in UI (File Uploads, Conversions, ...)
- [x] Export Data (Uploaded Files, Chat History, ...)
- [x] View and Manage Imported Files
- [x] About Tab in Sidebar
- [x] Docker Support
- [ ] Implement Log Library
- [ ] Re-write Docstrings

### Known Issues & Bugs
- [ ] Refreshing the page loses all state (expected Streamlit behavior; need to implement local-storage)
- [x] Files can be uploaded before Ollama config is set, leading to embedding errors
- [ ] Assuming Ollama is hosted on localhost, Models are automatically loaded and selected, but the dropdown does not render the selected option
- [ ] Upon sending a Chat message, the File Processing expander appears to re-run itself (seems something is not using state correctly)
