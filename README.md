# Bad App

A sample Flask application with two endpoints:

- `/`: A simple Hello World endpoint which returns an HTTP 200 as expected
- `/error`: An endpoint with logic errors and incorrect logging of HTTP error codes, resulting in HTTP 200 even in the event of an error

This is a demonstration of how HTTP error codes can incorrectly be implemented in an application, which can mask errors and hide issues in observability tools.

Remember to log your HTTP codes correctly! ðŸ˜Š

### Setup

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install && pipenv shell
